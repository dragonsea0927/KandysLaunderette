# Kandy's Launderette online store
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). I created to demonstrate my Server Side Rendering knowledge & general web development skills. Specifically, Next.js, HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript /jQuery, Git/ Github.

# Project Context
Kandy's Launderette is a small Dry-cleaning store providing a multitude of services, Duvets & Quilts Cleaning, Drying & Washing Machines, Washing Detergent, Professional Ironing and Stain Removing. As a dry-cleaning store all its services are all in-store experience however this store doesn't have an online website for its customers.

Therefore building a online website will provide Kandy's Launderette customers the opportunity to see the lists of services provided.

# My Objective
To build a Server Side Rendering project website. After going back and forth with the client this is the updated design. The first version of this website which is the minimum viable product website I already built is located below.

The main objecttive is to display the updated list of services provided by Kandy's Launderette. Listing these services will provide customers the opportunity to see the value of the store without having to contact the store.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
