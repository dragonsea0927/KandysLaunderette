# Kandy's Launderette online store
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). I created to demonstrate my Server side Rendering knowledge & general web development skills. Specifically, Next.js, HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript /jQuery, Git/ Github.

# Project Context
Kandy's Launderette is a small Dry-cleaning store providing a multitude of services, Duvets & Quilts Cleaning, Drying & Washing Machines, Washing Detergent, Professional Ironing and Stain Removing. As a dry-cleaning store all its services are all in-store experience however this store doesn't have an online website for its customers.

Therefore building a online website will provide Kandy's Launderette customers the opportunity to see the lists of services provided.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
